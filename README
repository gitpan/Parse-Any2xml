Parse::Any2xml parses any structured or unstructured  ASCII document through
 a template into an XML document. The templates are XML and easily represent
 what the output will be. They are fully documented, as is the module.

See docs/xtmpl-doc for how to write these templates (also called
XTMPLs). docs/time-sheets-template.xml shows an example XTMPL. If you are
confused, read docs/you-need-our-help and email us.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.
